description: "Let's step back for a second here. Human beings, the generations of innovators among us, somehow figured out a way to harness electricity and manipulate it so that it glows in different colors on our computer screens, make sound, communicate information, and make our lives easier in every imaginable way. We are more collectively aware of global phenomenons than ever before, we travel fast, we work less, our fantasies come true as we command it, and we get things done. Before that we had gas engines and steam powered machines, and fire that gave birth to our civilization as we know it.\_"

And now you're telling me, I won't ever see the sun again? or smell the air after the rain? Because of cars, cows, and some burnt coals???
